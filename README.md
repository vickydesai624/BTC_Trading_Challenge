Vikrant_BTC/USD Trading Strategy Backtesting Challenge Summary:
a. Strategy Logic
My trading hypothesis centers on Bitcoin's strong trending characteristics that can be
systematically captured through convergence of RSI (14-period), MACD, and 50-day SMA
indicators. I developed entry logic requiring RSI â‰¥ 30 (oversold recovery), MACD crossing above
signal line (bullish momentum), and price above SMA (uptrend confirmation), with reverse
conditions for exits. This multi-indicator approach filters false signals while capturing substantial
price movements during trending phases.
b. Key Performance Metrics
My system achieved 684.6% returns ($6,846 profit on $1,000) over 2019-2023, significantly
outperforming Bitcoin's 363.95% buy-and-hold benchmark with an excellent Sharpe ratio of 5.05.
The strategy executed 20 trades with 45% win rate, averaging 37-day holding periods, with
largest win of $6,206 during 2020-2021 bull market. Average wins of $1,435 substantially
exceeded average losses of $552, though maximum drawdown reached 48.98% with an 8-trade
losing streak during 2022 bear market.
c. Comparison/Ranking
This represents my single algorithmic trading strategy submission, demonstrating a good
backtesting with proper lookahead bias detection and realistic transaction cost modeling. The
strategy's ability to nearly double benchmark returns while maintaining better risk-adjusted
performance positions it as a strong systematic cryptocurrency trading solution.
